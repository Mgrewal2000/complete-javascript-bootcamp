    //let manu = "I love janushkaa"
    //if (manu === "I love janushkaa") alert("He's a simp god damn")
    // if you want to see your changes made to the website (.html) in real time, need to save and refresh.
    // console.log("text here") also allows you to put it on the console on terminal on browswer...Inspect --> console --> see the result...Console is for developers..aka help debug
